          <h2>What is Risk?</h2>
          <p>Risk is simply the possibility of something bad happening. Every decision you make has risk involved. </p>
          <p>For example, think about riding a bike. You can move much faster, travel farther, and sometimes use the road. However, the chance of injury is higher compared to walking.</p>
          <p><b>Risk tolerance</b> is the amount of risk someone is willing to take. Each person has a different level of risk tolerance.</p>

          <h2>Risk Terminology</h2>
          <p>Here are some terms that are related to risk:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Asset:</b> Something you want to protect. For example, your phone would be considered an asset.</li>
            <li><b>Vulnerability:</b> A weakness in protection. An example of a vulnerability is a weak password for your phone.</li>
            <li><b>Threat:</b> Someone or something trying to exploit a vulnerability. For example, if someone knows you have a weak password, they could try to access your phone. This person or action is the threat.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
          <p>There are two main factors when it comes to calculating risk:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>How severe the bad outcome is.</li>
            <li>How likely it is that something bad will happen.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Risk Assessment Example</h3>
          <p>Imagine you are not doing well in a class and are considering cheating on a test. This could help you get a high score to boost your grade. However, the severity of the risk is that if you are caught, your test score becomes a zero and you might face punishment from the school. The likelihood of the risk can change, but let's assume your teacher is known for catching cheaters.</p>
          <p>Letâ€™s assess this risk:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Severity:</b> A zero on the test and potential punishment from the school.</li>
            <li><b>Likelihood:</b> High, especially because your teacher is known for catching cheaters.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Given the high likelihood and severe consequences, this risk would likely not be worth taking.</p>
